\section{No Man's Sky Interactive 3d Galaxy
Map}\label{no-mans-sky-interactive-3d-galaxy-map}}

No Man's Sky is a space exploration game that uses extensive procedural
generation to create a mind mindbogglingly massive open-world play
space. The game contains 255 galaxies, each of which contains 4.2
billion regions. Each region is a roughly 400 light-year cube of space
and home to around 100 to 600 star systems.\footnote{Each region has
  address space for 4096 systems but the vast majority of these are
  inaccessible `phantom' systems that do not appear on the in-game
  galaxy map and cannot be reached normally.} Finally, each system has
2-6 planets (counting moons).

The number of planets is so vast that the vast majority of them will
never be visited by anybody. Even with all users sharing a starting
galaxy (Euclid), in normal exploration, an individual player is often
the only person who has ever seen a given planet they land on.

Each world in No Man's Sky are addressed and reachable via an in-game
portal network using its unique portal address. This address uses a
unique 16 glyph system that translates nicely to hexadecimal. In each
address, the final 8 characters translate to hexadecimal coordinates in
3d space. Two for the y axis, and three each for the X and Z axis. These
coordinates identify the galactic region containing the system.

No Man's Sky includes a `photo mode' feature which includes an overlay
in the lower left corner displaying the current galactic coordinates in
glyphs. Using this feature with the screenshot feature, users can take
and share images of their travels with coordinates included. An entire
community of players engage in this activity on
reddit.com/r/NMSCoordinateExchange.

The goal of the proposed project is to create a tool that can take in
these screen captures, use machine learning to extract the glyphs,
translate them to coordinates, and plot the regions in an intuitive,
interactive 3D visualization (or several) in some kind of dashboard UI.
Mapping will be from both a local directory of personally captured
images representing my own explored space, as well as images scraped
from Reddit to stand in as an approximation of globally explored space.

The project would initially start as a local-only Python analysis tool
(package), with the possibility of being extended into a small web
application.

\hypertarget{reason-for-selection}{%
\subsection{Reason for Selection}\label{reason-for-selection}}

I came up with this idea as a way to get some exposure to basic neural
networks and computer vision while doing something I am personally
interested in. I also expect to be able to further develop my data
visualization skills using some tools I've been aware of but have not
had the opportunity to explore.

\hypertarget{data-science}{%
\subsection{Data Science}\label{data-science}}

I think the image classification, machine learning, and data
visualization elements here are enough to qualify this as a data science
project. That said, I will be looking for ways to perform additional
analysis on the information I scrape from the web. This project is much
more descriptive than predictive analytics. While I understand the DS
certificate program's focus on predictive analytics, I think descriptive
analytics, particularly for spatial things like mapping, are very
interesting and worth exploring further.
